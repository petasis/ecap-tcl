  * library/ecap-tcl.tcl.in:
  * library/ecap-tcl.tcl: Added support for getting encoding from text
  content, if such information is not present in HTTP headers.

2017-09-19  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>

  * generic/cmds.cc:
  * generic/ecap-tcl.cc: Added support for the "proper" and "improper"
  bytearray types that Tcl seems to use internally.

2017-08-13  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>

  * library/ecap-tcl.tcl.in:
  * library/ecap-tcl.tcl: Added support for the brotli encoding (if package
  brotli is found: http://wiki.tcl.tk/48939).

2016-12-26  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>

  * configure.ac: Changed version to 0.3.

  * generic/ecap-tcl.h:
  * library/ecap-tcl.cc: Added the ability to register multiple versions of the
  adapter, with different ids. Adapter::Service constructor now accepts a
  suffix, which is appended at the end of ECAPTCL_IDENTITY_URI. The default
  suffix (defined in ECAPTCL_IDENTITY_URI_SUFFIX) is the empty string.

  * generic/ecap-tcl-identity.h: Moved various definitions that relate to the
  identity of the eCAP adapter to a new file, which allows the redefinition of
  the various strings at compilation (in case somebody wants to create an
  adapter with a different identity).

  * library/ecap-tcl.tcl
  * library/ecap-tcl.tcl.in: Fixed a bug in wantsUrl. Moved storage of the uri
  from onWantsUrl to onActionStart. The new command,
  "::ecap-tcl::action client request_uri" is now used.

  * generic/cmds.h:
  * generic/cmds.cc: New command "::ecap-tcl::action client request_uri". It
  returns the request uri.

  * library/ecap-tcl.tcl
  * library/ecap-tcl.tcl.in: Changed ::ecap-tcl::UncompressProcessor, now it
  automatically restores the original compression of the data.

2016-12-24  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>

  * library/ecap-tcl.tcl
  * library/ecap-tcl.tcl.in: Changed the library code for wantsUrl, as
  call_client_no_action is not working correctly for this case.

2016-12-13  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>

  * library/ecap-tcl.tcl
  * library/ecap-tcl.tcl.in: Changed "headers add" to "headers set".

  * generic/cmds.cc: Differentiate "headers set" from "headers add", with
  "headers set" removing all previous headers with the same name.

2016-12-13  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>

  * [Release]: Released ecap-tcl v0.2

  * generic/cmds.h:
  * generic/cmds.cc: New command (action content bytelength). Changed "action
  header add/set" to remove any previously defined header with the same name
  before adding a new one.

  * generic/ecap-tcl.h:
  * generic/ecap-tcl.cc: host->useAdapted() is called in noteVbContentDone(),
  so as headers can be modified by "contentDone". Modifications to the headers
  done by "actionStop" will be lost.

  * library/ecap-tcl.tcl.in: Various fixes in the library.

2016-12-11  Georgios Petasis  <petasis@iit.demokritos.gr>

  * First beta version (v 0.1)
