  * [Release]: Released ecap-tcl v0.2

  * generic/cmds.h:
  * generic/cmds.cc: New command (action content bytelength). Changed "action
  header add/set" to remove any previously defined header with the same name
  before adding a new one.

  * generic/ecap-tcl.h:
  * generic/ecap-tcl.cc: host->useAdapted() is called in noteVbContentDone(),
  so as headers can be modified by "contentDone". Modifications to the headers
  done by "actionStop" will be lost.

  * library/ecap-tcl.tcl.in: Various fixes in the library.
